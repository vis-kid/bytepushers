Searching for property online is usually less pleasant than nosediving into a cactus plantation. Darius Cheung’s newest company, the Sequoia Capital-backed 99.co, is cleaning up the daunting property search space in Singapore — big time.

Darius, an investor, serial entrepreneur, technologist, dreamer and family man, passionately shares his views on building companies, investing, technological opportunities, capitalism and hopes for a more inclusive economic future. We are very glad to know that founders like Darius, people who aim beyond a sole for-profit motive, are out there hustling for their version of the greater good.
