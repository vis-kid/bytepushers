Ernest Sim is one of the founders of Grain, an online restaurant startup in Singapore that wants to make healthy food accessible for everyone. In this episode of Bytepushers, Ernest shares his perspectives on startups and investor related topics, giving us a proper reality check of what startup life and work are like in Singapore and beyond.

We found Ernest to be a humble, down to earth and inspirational person – the kind of guy who manages to succeed even when the odds are stacked against him. During both visits to his office, it was very inspiring to see him with his team in action. Having a bunch of motivated and happy people working together like this seems to be a good indicator for future success. They truly felt like a tight-knit family. By the way, the Grain food was great as well. Friggin’ yummy! Especially the four servings of chocolate cake I had for dessert…
